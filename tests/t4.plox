  testing Semantic Analysis in PyLox
  The resolver step allows a correspondence between the result obtained 
  when interpreting a given statement, where a variable appears, 
  and the result of performing a semantic analysis on the same statement. 
  In the process, all variable references are resolved to their specific declaration.
